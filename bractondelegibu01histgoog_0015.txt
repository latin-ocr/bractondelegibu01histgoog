PREFACE ix

A word of explanation is demanded by the rubrics. Whether or not
Bracton himself wrote the rubrics, and whatever may have been their posi·
tion and importance in the original MS.‚ all the MSS. now extant have
them. Therefore in reproducing this feature we are making the text appear
as it must practically always have appeared to users of Bracton MSS. from
the· beginning. It was planned to give variant readings for the rubrica as
for the text, but the plan was abandoned after the necessary collation had
shown that the use of the large amount of space which would be required
to indicate the results of this collation would not be justified by the con·
fused and indefinite character of these results. A few facts in regard to

the rubrics should be kept in mind, however. Not every MS. has a table of
rubrica at the beginning; in many MSS. the kalendar has been copied
from a source different from that of the text, the rubrics of the kalendar
agreeing with one tradition and those in the text with another; even when

seemingly from the same tradition, the rubrics in the two places may vary
greatly; in but a very few of the MSS. do the rubrics in the kalendar agree
with those in the text. In different MSS. the same rubric may be used for
different plaoes in the text-places near together or far apart. It did not
seem necessary to indicate where these breaks in the text occurred in indi-
vidual MSS, some of them being clearly accidental, and the MSS. for the
most part being in harmony asto where the breaks and the rubrics should
come.

For the addicioaea, the list in Vol. I, ata-422, should always be consulted
in connection with the text as given here. The preparation of this second
volume has resulted in the discovery of a very few more additional passages
which may be added to that list. These are all given in the text and have
been marked in the usual way. It is hardly necessary to warn those ,inter-
ested in the subject that the significance of the variant readings given for
the addicionca can often be understood only by recalling the fact that it is
not unusual for a MS. to have its text from one tradition and its addicionea
from another.

Itis to be hoped that the attempt now under way to bring about a uni·
form orthography in the editing of medieval Latin texts will be successful.
Hitherto there has been considerable feeling on that point but no uniform-
ity. In the absence of a well-recognized and authoritative set of rules, the
matter resolves itself largely into a question of expediency for each editor.
Or the situation may be controlled by the nature of the document or the
manuscript material. Where a medieval Latin document or text existing
in only a single MS. is to be printed, all the arguments are in favor of
making an exact reproduction of that MS. The situation is not at all the
same where the text to be edited is found in scores of MSS. of different
