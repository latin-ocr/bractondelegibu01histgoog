periods and characteristica From the standpoint of orthography, the same
editor may adopt different plans in different circumstances. A good illus-
tration of this is to be found in the case of Bractoo's Note Book and
Bracton aad Azo. The first of these had to do with a single MS.; it was
printed with its medieval word forms intact. The second was concemed
with two medieval texts, each found in many manuscripts spread over
several generations. Here the modern spelling of Latin words was used.
Το us there seems nothing illogical in this difference between the two
books. Were Bracton's own copy of the Dc Legibus available, we should
insist on its being reproduced as the single MS. of the Note Book was
reproduced. But Bracton's original MS. has disappeared3 we are under
the necessity of using a considerable number of MSS. in place of it; we are
confronted with all the vagaries of medieval spelling and punctuation. We
are able to restore with practically no misgivings the important thing, ·
Braeton's own words; yet often we can not feel at all certain as to the exact
form of these words as they left his pen. When in one and the same place
among the oldest surviving descendants of the original MS. we find the
same word spelled in three, four, five, or even six different ways, we may
well hesitate to ascribe to Bracton himself any single one of these forms.
Under all the circumstances that have to be taken into consideration, it has
seemed best to us to follow in general the plan adopted by all the editors
of Bracton’s treatise in the past. We have therefore given classical or pre·
medieval words their now generally accepted form. For purely medieval
words we have chosen that form most usually found in the MSS.

One word should, perhaps, be referred to in particular. For the dative
and ablative plural of the demonstrative pronoun the MSS. give either eie
or biis, the forms iia and lu'a never occurring (except, infrequently, bia for ia
in the nominative singular). From the fact that hee (θα) and baedam
(ecdem) are the usual manuscript forms of these words, it might seem that
biis was meant for hia. Yet the his of the Roman law passages quoted ver·
batim by Bracton invariably becomes hiis in the MSS. of his work; in these
and other MSS. from the same period hiis regularly occurs where we should
expect aia the bia found in the earlier (late XIIth-early XIIIth cent.)
MS. of Glanvill becomes biis in the later (late XIIIth·early XIVth cent.)
MSS. of the same treatise. We have therefore uniformly given to the hiis
of the MSS. the form ha.

Though we could not impose upon the kindness of our colleagues by
asking them to undertake the thankless taslr of reading proof for this
volume, we have nevertheless not hesitated to aslr their advice at sundry
times in regard to matters connected with it. For the help fraely and gladly

given we again tender our thanks. We are especially indebted to Professor
